DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_K37_1|Now this one’s interesting - an old Rusatom Antonoff K37, designation {random/ship/1/shipname}, drifting in the A-Ring. No distress beacons, no signs of impact. Just... dead quiet. First one here gets the prize!

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_K37_2|Fresh ping from the polar telescope array. A K37-TNTRL, tag {random/ship/1/shipname}, is drifting cold in a shadowed ridge near the A-ring bulge. No thruster signatures, no distress pings. Either the crew bailed, or someone made sure they would not. If you can get her running, she is yours.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_K37_3|Heads up, wreck chasers. A K37-TNTRL, tag {random/ship/1/shipname}, was spotted by an excavator crew skimming for beryllium-rich deposits. No scorch marks, no hull breaches, just sitting idle in the dust. Could be a clean haul, or you might have to fight someone who thinks they own it.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_K37_LCB_1|Long-range scans picked up a drifting KX37, tag {random/ship/1/shipname}, tumbling slow near a metallic-rich debris cluster. One heat signature, no comms, registered to a deceased fellow by name of {random/person/1/firstname} {random/person/1/lastname}. You want a good hauler? This is your shot.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_K37_LCB_2|We got a fresh ping out of a polar telescope array, and visuals seem to confirm the extended version of classic K37 - a rare find! Long-distance transponder sweeps show up as {random/ship/1/shipname}. If you can tow her, she is yours!

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_K37_LCB_3|Rare sighting from a passing miner - a KX37-TNTRL, designation {random/ship/1/shipname}. Long cargo bay model, no visible damage. Either someone dumped her or something bigger chased her off. If you need storage, this one is worth the trip.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_K37_TRTL-R_1|Excavation crew flagged a KR37, tag {random/ship/1/shipname}, sitting cold near a mining corridor. Looks like the science team packed up in a hurry - airlock is wide open, no emergency beacons. Transponder still pinging. Could be a clean haul, or someone might come back for it.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_K37_TRTL-R_2|Fresh wreck report - KR37 by name of {random/ship/1/shipname}, spotted near a dense dust cloud. Heavy shielding still holding, but she is dead in the water. These models are rare, and their onboard computers do not come cheap. If the Obonto 600 is still intact, that alone could make the trip worth it.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_K37_TRTL-R_3|Long-range radar return on a KR37-TNTRL, designation {random/ship/1/shipname}, drifting near an old research site. Hull shows no damage, but power signatures are fluctuating. Could be a bad reactor, could be interference from the ringstorms. If you can stabilize her, you might walk away with some high-grade scientific hardware.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_K37_TRTL-T_1|We have a flagged recovery tug sighting - KTA24-TNTRL, designation {random/ship/1/shipname}, last registered to {random/person/1/lastname}. Scanners show her running dark near an old wreck site, no distress signal, no sign of a crew. This was supposed to be a routine job. If you are out there, {random/person/1/firstname}, let us know you are still breathing.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_K37_TRTL-T_2|Another freelancer thought they could cut it solo. KTA24, pinging as {random/ship/1/shipname}, got caught in an ice drift and now she is dead weight. Reverse thrusters misaligned, no maneuvering power - looks like someone did not read the manual. If you want an easy salvage, go teach this independent how the real professionals do it.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_K37_TRTL-T_3|Another overconfident freelancer just made a donation to the rings. KTA24, tag {random/ship/1/shipname}, was spotted tumbling with thrusters flickering. No signs of a crew - probably too embarrassed to call for help. If you are looking for a tug, it is just sitting there, waiting for someone with actual skill.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_EIME_1|Surprise, surprise - another trust fund genius thought a high-performance yacht could handle ring debris. EIME, designation {random/ship/1/shipname}, is now a very expensive piece of space junk. Fusion drive offline, computer system fried, and the idiot who parked it here is nowhere to be found. You want to own a billionaire's mistake? Go claim it.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_EIME_2|Well, well, look what just showed up on long-range scans - an EIME, designation {random/ship/1/shipname}, floating helpless in the mid-A ring. Probably came out here for a ‘real work experience’ before their trust fund payout, only to realize ring debris does not care how much your ship cost. If you feel like stripping some overpriced tech, this one is all yours.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_EIME_3|Some genius brought an EIME - yes, a fusion yacht - into a dense excavation corridor. And guess what? They are gone, and it is still here. Transponder reads {random/ship/1/shipname}, no distress beacon, no signs of emergency ejection. Either they got themselves a very expensive ride home, or they are learning what vacuum tastes like.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_TITAN_1|Long-range radar just flagged an Antonoff-Titan K225, designation {random/ship/1/shipname}, sitting cold near a low-density debris field. She is way too big for a standard tow, so if you are thinking of hauling her out, you had better bring friends. Cargo pods are still attached - no telling if they are full, empty, or rigged with surprises. Proceed with caution.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_TITAN_2|We have a ghost on our hands. A K225, designation {random/ship/1/shipname}, was spotted drifting near an old excavation site. No beacon, no response, just a dead giant in the dark. If you want this one, you are probably going to need to EVA in and power her up from the inside. Hope you like working in zero-G with no backup.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_TITAN_3|Polar telescope array flagged a fully intact Antonoff-Titan K225, designation {random/ship/1/shipname}, sitting dead with zero visible damage. No distress calls, just a massive hulk waiting for someone to board her and flip the breakers. If you can get her running, you might walk away with the biggest payday of your career - or find out why she was left behind.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_TITAN_BB_1|This one is almost too clean. Antonoff-Titan K225, pinging as {random/ship/1/shipname}, spotted completely intact by a mining crew nearby. Cargo pods locked in place, and yet… no crew, no response. If you have got the tools to board her and fire up the reactor, you might just walk away with a fully functional hauler. Just do not ask why it was abandoned.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_TITAN_BB_2|Heads up, scrappers - this one might already have an owner. K225, designation {random/ship/1/shipname}, was flagged by a passing hauler. Cargo pods are half-detached, hull shows signs of cutting torch work, and there is an odd residual heat signature in the habitat module. Either someone is living in there, or someone is watching from a distance to see if you do the hard work for them. Move fast, move smart.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_KITSUNE_1|We got a weird one today. A Kitsune-class shuttle, designation {random/ship/1/shipname}, was flagged by a passing miner. Docking clamps still extended, like it was ripped off its mothership mid-flight. No signs of impact or explosion, just... missing the ship it belonged to. If you claim it, maybe check the logs. Or maybe don’t.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_KITSUNE_2|Polar telescope array caught a slowly tumbling Kitsune-class shuttle, designation {random/ship/1/shipname}, moving through a low-density section of the A-ring. No escape pod launches, no pressure loss, no sign of what happened to the pilot. If you need a utility craft, this could be a clean grab. Just don’t ask why it’s empty.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_KITSUNE_3|We got an ND-LIS Kitsune, pinging as {random/ship/1/shipname}, parked sideways on a chunk of ice like its pilot tried to land in zero-G and failed. No hull breaches, no real damage, just a shuttle sitting where it absolutely shouldn’t be. Probably some freelancer who thought \"compact\" meant \"indestructible.\" If you want an easy salvage, this one’s a freebie.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_OCP_1|We got a sighting of an OCP 209, pinging as {random/ship/1/shipname}, parked in a mid-density ice field like someone was building something and then walked away. Hull’s intact, manipulators are still attached. If you want a ship that can carry half the station with it, get in before someone else claims the parts.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_OCP_2|Heads up, wreck chasers - an entire orbital construction platform just turned up in long-range scans. OCP 209, designation {random/ship/1/shipname}, fully intact but completely silent. No distress calls, no crew response, just sitting dead in the rings.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_OCP_3|Polar telescope flagged an OCP 209, designation {random/ship/1/shipname}, drifting way too clean in an active excavation zone. Either someone ditched a perfectly good construction rig, or they want you to think they did. Big hull, big manipulators, and way too much potential to be just \"forgotten.\" If you go in, go in ready.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_PROSPECTOR_1|Long-range radar flagged an Eagle Prospector, designation {random/ship/1/shipname}, drifting with a dead reactor. No signs of impact, no distress pings - just sitting in the dust, waiting for a pilot who knows how to flip breakers. If you need a workhorse, this one is ready for a second shift.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_PROSPECTOR_2|We got an odd one today - Eagle Prospector, designation {random/ship/1/shipname}, was spotted still clamped to an asteroid. Grinder is halfway through a cut, ore readings show high-density deposits, but the crew? Nowhere to be found. Either they stepped out for a coffee break and never came back, or something made them leave in a hurry.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_PROSPECTOR_3|Excavation crew reported an Eagle Prospector floating way too clean in a dense ore field, tag {random/ship/1/shipname}. No structural damage, no hull scoring, and yet, no crew. If you want a fully functional mining rig, she is yours - just ask yourself why no one else has claimed her.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_PROSPECTOR_LUX_1|We got a weird one - Peacock Prospector, designation {random/ship/1/shipname}, spotted fully powered, with fresh environmental readings, but no crew. Long-range thermal scan shows the espresso machine is still warm. Either someone just stepped out, or this ship is making coffee for ghosts.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_PROSPECTOR_LUX_2|Heads up, scrappers - someone tried to bring their luxury ride into the rings and failed spectacularly. Peacock Prospector, pinging as {random/ship/1/shipname}, is just sitting there, pristine, abandoned, and completely useless without a pilot. Probably some corporate heir trying to \"experience the working class.\" If you can tolerate leather seats, she is yours.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_PROSPECTOR_LUX_3|This one looks too clean. A Mitsudaya-Starbus Peacock Prospector, designation {random/ship/1/shipname}, was picked up by the polar telescope array, floating gently in a high-traffic mining corridor. No distress beacon, no signs of damage - just a perfectly preserved luxury mining ship waiting for someone to take it. If you want it, just be sure no one is waiting for you.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_PROSPECTOR_VP_1|A Vulture Prospector, designation {random/ship/1/shipname}, was flagged by long-range radar, drifting cold but fully intact. No breach, no reactor damage, nothing out of place - except that no sane person wants to fly one of these. If you are looking for a salvage-ready ship that will make you miserable, this one is waiting.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_PROSPECTOR_VP_2|We got a Conlido Vulture Prospector, designation {random/ship/1/shipname}, just floating near a half-milled rock, completely operational. Reactor is fine, thrusters are fine, but no one is flying it. Either the previous crew couldn’t take it anymore or they found something better. If you can handle the worst living conditions this side of a vacuum, she is yours.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_PROSPECTOR_VP_3|A wrecking crew passing through the A-ring flagged a Vulture Prospector, pinging as {random/ship/1/shipname}, parked way too neatly in a shadowed section of the rings. Hull scans show it is in perfectly flyable condition, which begs the question: why would someone leave a working salvage ship behind?

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_PROSPECTOR_FAT_1|We got a sighting on a Pelican Prospector named {random/ship/1/shipname}, sitting dead in the dust with her excavator still open. Either the pilot misjudged their load, or the ship’s center of mass finally caught up with them. You want a hauler? She is yours - just make sure you are ready to fight every turn.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_PROSPECTOR_FAT_2|We got an odd radar return on a Pelican Prospector, designation {random/ship/1/shipname}, drifting with no obvious damage but completely out of control. Thrusters are online, reactor is warm, but she is not responding to hails. Could be a nav system failure, could be a pilot that gave up mid-run. Either way, she is a whole lot of cargo space just waiting for a new owner.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_PROSPECTOR_FAT_3|Heads up, scrappers - an abandoned Pelican Prospector, designation {random/ship/1/shipname}, is parked near a mineral-rich ice belt. No signs of forced entry, no distress beacon. If you are looking for raw capacity, she has got it - just ask yourself why the last crew left without unloading.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_COTHON_1|Long-range radar flagged a Cothon-212 by name of {random/ship/1/shipname}, tumbling slow in the A-ring. Radiators shot to hell, RCS barely responding. But the cockpit? That lifepod-turned-bridge is still sealed tight. If you ever wanted to fly a cargo hauler from inside a glorified escape pod, now's your chance.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_COTHON_2|Heads up, scrappers - an abandoned Cothon-212, designation {random/ship/1/shipname}, was spotted drifting sideways through a high-density dust field. No hull breaches, but the pylon thrusters are completely misfiring. These things were never built for the rings, and now you can see why. If you want it, bring some patience.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_COTHON_3|We got an ancient one today - a Cothon-212, designation {random/ship/1/shipname}, that barely made it past its last burn before the rings took over. Looks like someone thought \"interlunar\" meant \"good enough for deep debris zones.\" If you want an antique hauler that handles worse than a frozen brick, she's all yours.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_COTHON_CHK_1|Heads up, wreck chasers - an abandoned Cothon-211, designation {random/ship/1/shipname}, was spotted parked clean in a excavation area. Reactor still warm, but no sign of the crew. Either someone got an unexpected ride home, or they left something in there they didn't want to deal with.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_COTHON_CHK_2|We got antique one today - a Chonker Cothon, designation {random/ship/1/shipname}, still clamped onto a half-cut asteroid like she was working before she gave up. Power grid looks intact, but she's not moving.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_COTHON_CHK_3|Wreck report just came in - a Cothon-211 registered as {random/ship/1/shipname}, excavator mount still in place, but her bay stripped clean. Either someone salvaged her piecemeal, or they only needed one specific thing before leaving the rest behind. If you’re good with repairs, she’s still got life in her.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_COTHON_LND_1|We got a \"Triplet\" Cothon-213, registered as {random/ship/1/shipname}, half-buried in an ice ridge, main torches still venting residual heat. Looks like someone got a little too confident with the thrust and forgot that these things handle like a drunk freighter. If you can dig her out, she is yours - assuming she does not launch herself into the next orbit the moment you hit the ignition.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_COTHON_LND_2|The polar telescope array just flagged a Cothon-213 by name of {random/ship/1/shipname}, scattered across a debris field. Main torches overburned and tore loose, frame cracked in three places, but the cargo bay looks mostly intact. If you are up for a messy salvage, this one is free - you just might have to find all the pieces first.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_COTHON_LND_3|We got a Cothon-213, listed under {random/ship/1/shipname}, wedged into a slow-moving ice cluster. No comms, just a whole lot of mass that clearly did not go where it was supposed to. These things were built to punch out of gravity wells - not thread the rings. If you want to claim it, bring a plan for how to keep it from torching itself into the next orbit.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_COTHON_V_1|A Cothon-217, previously logged as {random/ship/1/shipname}, just showed up on long-range scans, and it is not in the shape it was built in. \"Benders\" were made to flex their storage on demand, but something went wrong here - hull deformation, partial bay collapse, and a cargo hold that looks like it tried to turn itself inside out. If you can untangle the mess, she might still fly.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_COTHON_V_2|A rare find today - one of the few Cothon-217s ever built, registered as {random/ship/1/shipname}, floating cold in the A-ring. No hull breaches, no power. Looks like the cargo bay resized at the wrong time and bent the wrong way. The rest of the ship looks intact, but if you ever wanted a hauler that actively fights you for control, this one's a prime candidate.

DIALOG_SALVAGE_EXPOSE_DELAYED_COTHON_V_3|Polar telescope array flagged a Cothon-217 responding as {random/ship/1/shipname}, drifting in a dense ice cluster. The weird part? Its adaptive cargo system is still cycling. No crew, no power signatures, but the storage compartments are expanding and contracting like it's still in use. If you want to claim this one, you might want to figure out what's inside first.
