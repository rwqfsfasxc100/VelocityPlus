SYSTEM_CRADLE|THI Standalone Cradle

SYSTEM_CRADLE_SPECS|Power usage (nominal): 20 MW\nCradle mass: 500 kg\nManufacturer: Titan Heavy Industries

SYSTEM_CRADLE_DESC|A cheap, standalone cradle from the cargo container line of equipment produced by Titan Heavy Industries. Many captains may fail to see the use in entering the rings without anything attached to the cradle, however salvage crews may see benefit to having a readily accessible cradle to retrieve any lifepods or drones.

SYSTEM_CRADLE_MANUAL|Empty cradle arm can catch drones and lifepods.


VELOCITYPLUS_DESCRIPTION|Provides a large collection of togglable and tunable features. \n\nThe mod currently implements the following: \n\n * Show mineral market worth - displays the total value of your ore in the mineral market.\n * Add empty cradle equipment - Adds empty cradles to side hardpoints.\n * MVFS shader style - Allows the removal or swapping out of the shader used in the Minding Virtual Flight Service.\n * Hide portraits - Allows the crew portraits to be hidden wherever they may be visible outside of the crew menu.\n * Fix Voyager RSLS MPU in the OCP-209 - Flips the Voyager MPU in the OCP-209 to make it easier to fill.\n * Remove 200 m/s velocity limit - Removes the velocity limits set by the emergency autopilot.\n * Allow travel outside of the ring area - Lets you exit the normal play area (< 0km and > 3,006km depths).\n * Variate broadcasted location timers - Variates the times provided by other crews and personnel to make them feel more natural to being taken from their astrogation computer. Broadcasts include: locations provided by crew, locations provided by miner crews, SRO broadcasts, pirate container and ship locations.\n * Fix gimballed and turreted weapons in place - Prevents any equipment that can rotate from targeting, locking them to their 0 degree angle.\n * Hide undamaged equipment from repairs - Repair menu will only display equipment below 100%.\n * Add tooltips to Enceladus menus - Adds more tooltips to explain why you can or cannot do something.\n * Enable achievements - allows achievements and leadearboards to be earned with mods enabled.\n * Increase crew marker limits - Increases the number of tracked ores and transponders your crew can manage at once.\n * Manipulator arms lock on AP target - Having an object selected with the autopilot will have the AR-1500M target that above anything else.\n * Display negative depth - The HUD now displays distance from the rings as negative depth rather than blanking out.\n * Display dive time - Shows both realtime and total dive time in the mechanic tab.\n * Show equipment reliability - Displays equipment reliability information in the User Manual tab.\n * Toggle HUD & MPU - Adds keybinds to toggle the HUD's display or toggle the MPU's power.\n * Pilots reduce astrogation calculation time - Having a pilot onboard will help reduce the time it takes to calculate an astrogation jump. \n * Save stats - Display the stats of a save, including current money & insurance, and playtime.\n * Companion return behaviour - allow you to choose the default behaviour of companions when they run low on propellant, as well as extend the number of hail options once that happens.\n
